# Damn Useful Scripts

Just a list of scripts that grants a dev (like me) a happier life.

Coding guidelines: Try to make code in one line and as complex as possible.

### pj

Commandline JSON prettifier

```
$ pj '{"this_json_is":"ugly"}'
{
  "this_json_is": "ugly"
}
```

### gpass

Password generator (because rake/rails secret is slow and I don't want to leave the terminal for [http://passwordsgenerator.net/](http://passwordsgenerator.net/))

```
$ gpass 32
IBOLsHI96AhxdDldZETnTHWC8jnIdUkJ
```
